        <h2 class="article__subtitle">About AERS
        </h2>
        <p class="article__content">AERS (Advanced Error Recognition System) - is a security system that checks the code
          for the most dangerous errors that can only be caught by an experienced CNC programmer. AERS is so far able to
          test your code against over 40 potentially dangerous scenarios.
          <br />AERS is made up of three elements:
          <span>1. On-the-fly code verification (code verification already when writing the program)</span>
          <span>2. Run-time check (code testing for potential syntax errors, incorrect values such as "null",
            etc.)</span>
          <span>3. Additional checking of already pure G code (converted from macro) for potential errors</span>
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__subtitle">Why using AERS is so important?</h2>
        <img class="article__img" src="resources/error_console.png" alt="macro null alert" />
        <p class="article__content">Remember that the unit cost of most CNC machines starts at hundreds of thousands of
          dollars. Also, any damage to the tool means high costs (e.g., end mills) and wasted time on its replacement
          and measurements, and often needed changes in the CNC program. Even the smallest error can immobilize your CNC
          machine for many months or cause a dangerous accident! AERS can prevent many potentially dangerous situations
          by checking your code before running it on a milling machine or machining centers.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__subtitle">But I am an experienced CNC programmer / machinist. Why should I use AERS?
        </h2>
        <img class="article__img" src="resources/tabler-alert.png" alt="macro null modal alert" />
        <p class="article__content">Remember that the human brain works much slower in the morning or late hours. Also
          at work requiring a lot of concentration and precision, after 4-5 hours there is a lot of fatigue. This can
          create a dangerous situation in your workplace. AERS in Macro Mill Plus CNC does not need time to rest. It is
          always ready to help you create a better and safer CNC program.
          .</p>
        <h2 class="article__subtitle">How easy is to undestand warning and alerts from AERS?</h2>
        <img class="article__img" src="resources/zoomed-notification.png" alt="in line notifications" />
        <p class="article__content">AERS will notify you by displaying a red shield (if there is an error, the run
          button will disappear) or an orange shield (if there is a warning) in the top bar.

        </p>

        <p class="article__content">The line number will also be marked in color. For more information about a potential
          alert or warning, you can press the line number. After clicking, a window with a description of the situation
          should appear.

        </p>

        <p class="article__content"> As you can see it is very simple.
